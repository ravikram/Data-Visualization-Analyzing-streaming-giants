This project delves into the world of streaming giants, conducting a comparative analysis of Netflix and Amazon Prime Video using Tableau.  I crafted over 13 interactive dashboards that unearthed valuable insights for a diverse audience:

 - **Emerging Streaming Platforms**: Understand user preferences and content consumption trends to develop strategic content offerings. (Market Share Overview, Content Evolution, Engagement)
 - **Production Houses**: Identify popular genres and viewing patterns to tailor content for success on streaming platforms. (Content Evolution, Original Content)
 - **Wider Consumer Audience**: Explore content and identify shows that align with their preferences through interactive dashboards, enhancing their streaming experience. (Cost Analysis, Monetization, Engagement)

This project showcases my expertise in:

 - **Data Visualization** with **Tableau**: Creating impactful and insightful dashboards to communicate complex data effectively.
 - **Comparative Analysis**: Identifying key differences and similarities between leading streaming platforms.
 - **User Behavior Analysis**: Understanding user preferences and content consumption trends across a broad audience. (Content Evolution, Engagement)
